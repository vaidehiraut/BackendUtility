RESTFull APIs 
Act as a translator between 2 machines communicating over web services.
Returns json files


DRF
Used for developing RESTFull APIs
It has a web browsable web API 
It has authentication policies


Models - Tables for the DB
View - Functions for URLs
URL - URLs for View Functions

Serializers: 
Before sending data to client we need to serialize it to json & APIs and results is always json.
Similar as Django forms (forms.py)
When you define a Serializer, you need to specify all fields from the models.

>>> from api.models import Sample
>>> from api.serializers import SampleSerializer
>>> from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
>>> from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser 
>>> a = Sample(title = 'Test1', email='test@gmail.com') 
>>> a.save()

when we call above save(), it is calling create method

>>> serializer = SampleSerializer(a)                     
>>> serializer.data # it is a dictionary
{'title': 'Test2', 'email': 'test2@gmail.com', 'date': '2022-02-15T04:49:17.543676Z'}

Now at this point we have translated the models and its instances into python native datatype.
Now to finalise the serialization process, we need to render this data into json.

>>> content = JSONRenderer().render(serializer.data)
>>> content
b'{"title":"Test2","email":"test2@gmail.com","date":"2022-02-15T04:49:17.543676Z"}'

We have got the serialized data.

Now to seralize a queryset,

>>> serializer = SampleSerializer(Sample.objects.all(), many=True)
>>> serializer.data
[OrderedDict([('title', 'Test1'), ('email', 'test@gmail.com'), ('date', '2022-02-15T04:49:07.267703Z')]), OrderedDict([('title', 'Test2'), ('email', 'test2@gmail.com'), ('date', '2022-02-15T04:49:17.543676Z')])]

We have got the serialized data of the queryset.


ModelSerializers:
Our SnippetSerializer class is replicating a lot of information that's also contained in the Snippet model. 
It would be nice if we could keep our code a bit more concise.

In the same way that Django provides both Form classes and ModelForm classes, REST framework includes both Serializer classes, 
and ModelSerializer classes.

repr() = representation of.

>>> serializer = SampleSerializer()
>>> print(repr(serializer)) 
SampleSerializer():
    title = CharField(max_length=100)
    email = EmailField(max_length=100)
    date = DateTimeField()

Status:
200 = Ok
201 = created
400 = bad request
403 = Forbidden
404 = not found
204 = Delete / no content

Function based API views

api_view() decorator in Function based API views 
it used to ensure it receives an instance of request rather than usual Django Http request.
also it allows to return a response rather than usual Django Http response.
also you can access to django web browsable API view.

Now we dont need to 
1.return Json response, we will return rest_framework response
2.parse the data from post/put method ( remove "data = JSONParser().parse(request)" )

introduced to:
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status


Class based API Views:
This is a powerful pattern that allows us to reuse common functionalities.
Also it helps as to keep our code DRY (Dont repeat yourself)
Requests passed to the handler methods will be REST framework's Request instances, not Django's HttpRequest instances.
Handler methods may return REST framework's Response, instead of Django's HttpResponse. The view will manage content 
negotiation and setting the correct renderer on the response.


Generic Views:
The generic views provided by REST framework allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to your database models.
If the generic views don't suit the needs of your API, you can drop down to using the regular APIView class, or reuse 
the mixins and base classes used by the generic views to compose your own set of reusable generic views.


Logging levels:
logging levels allow us to specify exactly what we want to log by seperating into different categories.
There are 5 standard logging levels.
1. DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problem.
2. INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
3. WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. 'disk space low')
            The software is still working as expected.
4. ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
5. CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.


paramiko = creates SSH sessions to clients.
rich = make output look nice and pretty.
